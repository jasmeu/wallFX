copy here in this folder the file:
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf
you should find on your PI.
If you are unable to find it, copy into this folder whatever other TTF file you find. The internet is full of Open Source TTF fonts. It should not matter which one you use.
(In case you copy other font file, you either call it DejaVuSans.ttf or you rename both in the .css file as well in the code according to your file name)
